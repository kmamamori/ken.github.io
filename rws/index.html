				<div class="detail">
					<p>According to the article, Defining the Heisei Era: the fragmentation of the family in Japan, talks about
						how poverty or amount of salary is affecting the families in Japan. After the bubble economy collapsed,
						Japanese family started to have many kinds of issues which led to divorce in many cases. However, many
						people think Japan as one of the richest countries and all the people in Japan live wealthy as well. In this
						essay, I will introduce data and facts of how people in Japan are facing poverty with explanation of
						rhetorical appeals.</p><br>
					<p>On the article, it shows how modern family divorce rate has changed significantly and single rate (not
						married) has grown this past 30 years. The article stated, \‚Äú80 percent of 20-40 years-old live with, and
						financially reliant on, their parents\‚Äù. This sentence shows that the majority of the youths cannot afford
						themselves and have to depend on their parent since the salary is low. I compared two cities, one from Japan
						called Saitama ( my hometown ) and another from El Paso, Texas through a website called, NUMBEO, which
						allows to compare cities in terms of: cost of living, property prices, crime, health care, pollution,
						traffic, quality of life, and travel. According to the website NUMBEO, it tells us that El Paso is lower in
						consumer prices including rent and groceries prices for over 41% than Saitama, ad restaurant prices is lower
						than Saitama for 18.67%. However, the average monthly net salary in El Paso is greater than Saitama for
						15.82%. The website also states that, \‚ÄúYou would need around $2,449.50 in El Paso, TX to maintain the same
						standard of life that you have with $4,163.09 in Saitama.\‚Äù This demonstrates that living in Saitama (Japan)
						consumes more money than El Paso but make less money than El Paso. Two sentences with quotes are using
						rhetorical appeals of logos because it tells the facts, and data. In addition, it gives very interesting
						facts about other countries by comparing cities. Through this assignment, I learned more about my two
						hometown cities, which was truly interesting. As well as, analyzing rhetorical appeals helped me to
						understand this article even more than reading briefly.</p>

					<p>School lunches in U.S. have a terrible reputation. According to \‚ÄúUSA TODAY,\‚Äù good served in lunches would
						not meet the quality or safety standards of many fast-food restaurants. In addition, on the website Food
						Revolution Network, \‚Äúalmost half the vegetables eaten by most children aged 2 to 19 in the U.S. were French
						fries.\‚Äù The unhealthy lunch is causing many problems such as lack of learning and memory performance, more
						problematic behaviors like aggression and disciplinary problems, worse performance on exams, and upper rates
						of obesity. By writing this research, we can help students in public schools to be served better food in
						order to perform well in class and learn as much as they can.</p>

					<p>Corn dog, pizza, French fries, hamburger, and other lunch are easy to recognize as junk food or unhealthy
						food; however, they still appear on table during school lunch in the United States. One of the problems that
						should be addressed is the public-school lunch quality problem. According to Revolution Foods, 88 percent of
						parents, out of 1800 parents, and 66 percent of students, out of 1800 students both agreed that healthier
						school lunches should be served in school. Unhealthy food should be eliminated in schools and serve
						healthier lunches because of the following: better academic performance, better behavior, and prevent
						obesity. To further understand the beneficial aspects of serving healthier lunch in public schools will be
						explained in more detail below. </p>
					<p>Lack of unhealthy meals served in public schools are affecting students to perform well academically.
						According to Anderson et al.\‚Äôs article, it states that academic performance can be improved with better
						quality of school lunch. The authors, Anderson Gallagher and Ramirez Ritchie, cited that \‚Äúa school
						contracts with a healthy lunch company, students at the school score better ‚Ä¶ on average, student test
						scores are 0.03 to 0.04 standard deviations higher. Not only that, the test score increases are about 40
						percent larger for students ‚Ä¶ who are most likely to eat the school lunches\‚Äù. This demonstrates that
						healthier lunch in school had affected the students in a good way that made them score better on end-of-year
						academic tests. By giving foods with quality (healthy), made difference with academic performance and it is
						obvious that quality matters more than quantity. Talking about academic performance, a study published by
						Gomez-Pinilla, he states an interesting fact regarding kids learning skills. The study insists that foods
						that are commonly served during lunch, such as burgers, chicken nuggets, and French fries have a similarity.
						They are loaded with high levels of saturated fats which may impair learning and memorizing skills of kids.
					</p>
					<p>The quality of lunch has an affect toward academic performance as well as learning skills. In addition to
						this, it also helps to solve behavior problem. In 1985, Schoenthaler published a series of studies on 12
						juvenile correctional facilities, including 8076 young offenders. Dietary changes such as remove chemical
						additives, processed food, and reduced levels of sugar were held on the facilities and the result had
						positive impacts had happened. At a facility in Virginia, violence declined by 33% and theft dropped by 77%.
						At Los Angeles County probation detention centers detected a reduction of 44% in bad behavior, and in a
						probation in northern California found 25% decrease in violence and 42 % declined of horseplay. In both
						facilities in California, suicide attempts fell by 44%. Public schools and juvenile detention facilities are
						very distinct institution to compare. However, in a matter of healthiness there is no difference, and the
						study should apply to any students in public schools. As a result, improving public school lunch can help
						students to have a better behavior towards their families, teachers, and classmate and diminish to harm
						themselves.</p>
					<p>In recent years, obesity is becoming on of the major and most serious problem among American children.
						According to the webpage called ‚ÄúFacts About child Nutrition‚Äù states that ‚Äúthe rate of obesity among U.S.
						children has tripled in the past 30 years. Today, one in five American children is obese.‚Äú Obesity causes
						serious healthiness problems such as heart disease and diabetes. During the early life such as adolescent
						age, it determines the future habits. For example, if children learned to prefer and select healthier foods,
						they will repeat the same experience in the future. On the other hand, children who accustomed in eating
						junk food, tends to eat similar food. In addition to this, better (healthier) lunch can bring health for the
						kids. A study held by Florence et al. showed that student with access of healthy food choices have the
						potential to have better health. The amount of nutrition in healthy food is larger and each nutrition has
						their own role to work inside of bodies.</p>
					<p>In conclusion, changing to healthier lunches is one of the best and necessary modification that needs to be
						done in all the public schools, which needs to be changed. For example, in Japan, every public school hires
						a school lunch dietitian to serve healthy lunch for students, as well as for faculties. Also, every month
						school provides a menu for one month to every student to inform what ingredients are used and the amount of
						nutrition. In Italy, there is a law that forces public institutions to use both organic and local products.
						As introduced above, there are many positive impacts on serving better lunches with quality for any students
						and governments must act on this serious situation for thee children.</p>
